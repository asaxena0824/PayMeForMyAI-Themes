# PayMeForMyAI

## Introduction

PayMeForMyAI is a platform that enables creators to build and monetize AI Bots. AI Creators can charge their users per chat session, allowing them to generate revenue from their bots. 

To handle and receive payments, Bot creators can integrate their Stripe accounts. The revenue generated from interactions with their GPT is returned to the creator entirely (subtracting any fees charged by Stripe). 

There are no limits on the number of chats, and users don't need to have ChatGPT Plus to use any GPT bot on PayMeForMyAI.

## How to monetize your GPT? 

* Sign up or Log in on [PayMeForMyAI](https://www.paymeformyai.com/signup). 
* Connect your Stripe account to receive payouts.
* Click on `Create Bot` from the dashboard.
* Fill out the form to create your own GPT bot.
* Click on `Test` to test the bot or on `Launch` to launch the bot you created.
* Your bot is now launched! Click on it to use it, and share the link with others.
